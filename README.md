# 🧠 IBM Data Science Capstone Project
Welcome to my final project for the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate! This repository showcases an end-to-end data science workflow—from data acquisition and cleaning to machine learning modeling and interactive dashboard deployment.

## 🚀 Project Overview
This capstone project applies the full data science lifecycle to a real-world dataset. I explored multiple Python libraries, built predictive models, and created interactive visualizations to communicate insights effectively.
## 🧰 Tools & Libraries Used
- **Pandas** – Data manipulation and analysis
- **NumPy** – Numerical computations
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – Static and statistical visualizations
- **Scikit-learn** – Machine learning models and evaluation
- **Sqlite3** – Database connectivity and SQL integration
- **Folium** – Geospatial mapping
- **Dash** – Interactive dashboard development
- **Jupyter Notebook** – Step-by-step documentation and execution

## 🤖 Machine Learning Models
- **Logistic Regression** – Binary classification
- **Support Vector Machine** - Maximizes margin between classes using hyperplanes
- **Decision Tree Model**- Hierarchical, rule-based classification using feature splits **(The winner)**
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** – Instance-based classification

### 🧪 Model Evaluation
- Regression: RMSE, R² Score
- Classification: Accuracy, Precision, Score, Confusion Matrix
## 🧬 Feature Engineering
- **One-Hot Encoding**: Categorical variables were transformed using `pandas.get_dummies()` and `sklearn.preprocessing.OneHotEncoder` to ensure compatibility with ML models.
## 📊 Dashboard
An interactive dashboard was built using **Dash** and **Folium**, allowing users to:
- Filter and explore data dynamically
- Visualize trends and geospatial patterns
- Interact with model outputs in real time
## 📓 Notebook Highlights
All code and analysis are documented in Jupyter Notebooks, featuring:
- Clear markdown explanations
- Inline visualizations
- Reproducible workflows

## 💡 Key Takeaways
- Mastered integration of Python libraries into a cohesive data science pipeline
- Applied and evaluated multiple ML models
- Built a deployable dashboard for stakeholder-friendly insights
- Strengthened documentation and reproducibility practices
